AutoHotkeyScripts
=================

A collection of [AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) scripts that I use regularly.

- **MediaPlayer** - Turns the Caps Lock key into a Pause/Play button for media players (Spotify, iTunes, VLC, etc.). The script doesn't handle multiple players running at the same time well - It'll just pause/play both so you can end up where both media players dishing out music at the same time. I use this script every day.
- **SwitchOffMonitor** - When you press F1 the monitor gets switched off. If I know I'm going to be away from my computer for a while I can press F1 and the screen will switch off. I've only tested this on my laptop so don't know if this will work on desktop too.
